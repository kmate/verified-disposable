Disposable objects in Java with run-time usage verification.

## Purpose

This library provides run-time verification of instance field access and method invocation on objects which could be marked as disposed. Every time a field is accessed or a method is invoked on a `Disposable` object, the runtime calls its `isDisposed()` method to check whether the given instance is marked as disposed. In these cases a speicfic descendant of the run-time exception `UsageException` will be thrown to indicate invalid usage of a disposed object. Reading or writing a field will trigger `FieldAccessException`, while invocation of a method will rise `MethodInvocationException`. All of these exceptions are containing a reference of the target object and the name of the field or method used. Additionally, `FieldAccessException` also contains a flag which indicates whether a read or a write was performed on the given field. The `Disposable` interface does not determine how an object instance could be disposed, it is just provides a query for the verification about the state of a particular instance.

## Implementation

The implementation is based on [Java Instrumentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html) and on the [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org/) bytecode manipulation framework. When the instrumentation agent implemented by the `Agent` class is active, it registers a class transformer, which will manipulate all classes loaded thereafter. The transformation inserts a static call to the appropriate method of class `UsageVerifier` before each field access of `Disposable` objects, except for those which are done in the same `Disposable` class. Every non-static and non-private regular method of `Disposable` objects will also be extended with a similar check on its entry.
